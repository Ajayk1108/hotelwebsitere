          <p>We stayed here for 4 days in total, and it was a very good experience. Very dedicated and polite staff. I never had to wait for more than 5 mins for any request made on the phone. Very good in terms of cleanliness as well. The food was also good. I have stayed in many 4/5 star hotels, but the experience here stands out. Would definitely recommend it to others. Looking forward for my next stay in ROS, Bangalore.</p>
